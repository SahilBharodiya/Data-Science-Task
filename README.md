Part 1: Predict the price of a house
This jupyter Notebook includes data histograms, plots, co-relation, Pearson co-efficient calculation, feature importance, graph, and model development using XGBoost Regression.


Part 2: Product matching
In this jupyter notebook, product matching is done on the basis of the name of the product. It is done for all products on Flipkart and also for individual products. I use closing similarity.
